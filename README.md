# Welcome To Coolbeans Console Calculator!!!

### Where the calculations are just as fun as the app!!
______________________________________________________________

## **WHY BUILD THIS APPLICATION?**
> I've always been a ***heavy*** calculator user just due to efficency, and never really trusting myself with numbers, but I came across this quote,
>
>>“Everybody should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you how to think.” -Steve Jobs

>And decided to challenge myself by creating the one tool, that I am so reliant on to prove that I already have the logic, that I was used to getting from the tool. And if you're like me, this is just the console application for you! See if you can recreate it or make it better, all open source contributors WELCOME!!


## **Installation**
*  Clone the repository to you terminal, using the following http://...


    > https://github.com/usneed01/CalculatorApp.git

* And upon building the application, the calculation loop begins. Here's a STEP-BY-STEP instructional guide on how it works!

## **HOW IT WORKS**
_______________________________________________________________
### 1. ENTER your ***first*** number: (Enter any valid integer)
### 2. ENTER your ***second*** number:
### 3. SELECT your operation ***(+,-,/,*)***
### 4. NEXT, your solution is displayed like this...
    
     > The (SOULTION) of (FIRST NUMBER) and (SECOND NUMBER) is (OUTPUT)
       Want To Do Something Else ? If 'yes'then press and enter (Y).
       Else enter any key 
       
### 5. IF ANY KEY OTHER THAN Y, then, the user will be exited out of the calculator.
### 6. IF Y IS ENTERED, then user will be prompted to use ***CURRENT*** number, and perform another operation using another number.
### 7. This cycle of choosing another number and operation can continue as long as the user wants, and master loop finishes and closes when user selects ***ANY OTHER KEY***

## **WHAT DID I LEARN?**

* That C# is definitely not for the faint of heart!!!
* That creating something practical and useful, turns a project into a tool!
* .NET is full of fun features that should be explored!
